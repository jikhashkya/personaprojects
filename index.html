<h1>Installing Structure<h1>
<p>
On Linux System:
1) Check if 32bit or 64bit system using 
  <b>$uname -m</b>

  <p>1.1 32bit: Download the tar file (without frontend) and unzip with <b>$tar zxvf <filename></b>. This should extract to console folder inside of which you'll have structure executable.
    ./structure to run the program</p>
  
  <p>1.2: 64bit: The normal tarfile download won't work. Download the 'C' source file. Unzip as before. Go into the extracted folder and run <b>$make</b>. This should give you a executable
    with the same name.</p>
