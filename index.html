Installing Structure

On Linux System:
1) Check if 32bit or 64bit system using 
$uname -m

  1.1 32bit: Download the tar file (without frontend) and unzip with $tar zxvf <filename>. This should extract to console folder inside of which you'll have structure executable.
    ./structure to run the program
  
  1.2: 64bit: The normal tarfile download won't work. Download the 'C' source file. Unzip as before. Go into the extracted folder and run $make. This should give you a executable
    with the same name.
