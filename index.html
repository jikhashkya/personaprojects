    <h3>Installing Structure</h3>
    <p>
      On Linux System:
      1) Check if 32bit or 64bit system using 
        ```$uname -m```

      <p>1.1 32bit: Download the tar file (without frontend) and unzip with ```$tar zxvf <filename>```. This should extract to console folder inside of which you'll have structure executable.
      ./structure to run the program</p>
  
      <p>1.2: 64bit: The normal tarfile download won't work. Download the 'C' source file. Unzip as before. Go into the extracted folder and run <b>$make</b>. This should give you a executable
      with the same name.</p>
